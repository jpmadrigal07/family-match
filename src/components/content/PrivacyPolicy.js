                        </p>
                        <p>Last Updated: October 2018</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>These days everyone is concerned with privacy, and we at FamilyMatch ("we," "us," "our," or "FamilyMatch") get it. Given the sensitive nature of the material collected by many companies, users are understandably interested in knowing what is being done with their personal information. We created this Privacy Policy to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, store and manage the personal information that you provide in connection with your use of our website located at www.familymatch.com (the "Website"), any applications, tools or other related services offered by us, including, but not limited to our newsletter (collectively, the "Services").</p>
                        <p>By using the Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Privacy Policy the date it was last updated.</p>
                        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. If you use our Services after we have updated this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices. Use of the Services after changes are made to the Privacy Policy will be considered your consent to the new terms.</p>

                            <strong>The Young at Heart (and Age)</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sorry kiddos, you have many years ahead of you before you need to worry about finding the perfect match. The Services are for individuals 18 years of age or older. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.</p>
                        <p>We do not knowingly collect, keep, or maintain personal information from people under the age of 18. The Website is not directed toward people under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, then we ask that you please do not access, visit, or use the Website or the Services in any manner or at any time. If it is brought to our attention that personal information for people under the age of 18 years has been submitted through our Website, we will have Mr. Brooks efficiently delete this information. You can come back after you've turned 18.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Information We Collect About You</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The information we collect is required in order to provide you our match-making Services. It is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission. When you register for the Website, we collect user entered and submitted information that our fabulous robot, Mr. Brooks, can use to identify you such as your name, phone number and email addres. Once you've been acquainted with Mr. Brooks you will be requested to provide answers to our standard 10 questions and upload a photograph. This information is necessary in order for E. Jean Carroll and Kenneth Shaw to properly assess who to match you with. Additional authorized employees may be permitted to access your personal information, but this is only to provide you the Services.</p>
                        <p>When you use the Site or the Services, some additional information is automatically collected such as your Internet Protocol (IP) IP address, browser type, browser language, visit time, referring website adresses, profile information, aggregated user data, and cookie information.

                        <p>Non-personally-identifiable and aggregated information may be shared with third parties. These third parties might include, but are not limited to, advisors, advertisers, partners, affiliates and investors. We may also use this non-personally-identifiable and aggregated information to provide advertisements to our users, and to provide more effective services overall. We may also allow for third-parties, including but not limited to advertising companies, to show advertisements on our Website. Advertising companies and other third-parties may use their own tracking technologies (such as cookies) to gather and collect information about users who view, interact, or engage with their advertisements or promotions. We also reserve the right to share your information, personal or non-personal, with authorized service providers that may perform specific services or processes on our behalf. Such services may include, but are not limited to, customer service, customer support, and marketing, business, sales, or promotional contest assistance offered through our Website or Services. </p>
